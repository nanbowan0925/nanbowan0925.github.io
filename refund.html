  <h1>Refund Policy</h1>

  <p>The Sacred I Ching Oracle is a fully digital metaphysical offering. As such, all sales are final.</p >

  <h3>1. Digital Nature</h3>
  <p>Once your purchase is confirmed, access to the full downloadable content is immediately provided. Because of this, we cannot offer refunds, returns, or exchanges.</p >

  <h3>2. Alignment Before Purchase</h3>

  <h3>3. No Trial, No Preview</h3>
  <p>This is a spiritual transmission, not a software license. The energy within cannot be sampled or reversed once delivered.</p >
